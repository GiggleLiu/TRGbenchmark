# Benchmark of Different Tenosr Implement

Currently, these test focus on three different implement: using pytorch; using julia and using itensor.

The result is

| Implement | Time(average over 10 runs) |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| pytorch   |                            |
| julia     |                            |
| itensor   |                            |

## Details

The test is done on a mid 2014 MacBook Pro with a 2.2GHz Intel i7 processor. And the pytorch test doesn't utilize a GPU.

To perform this test on your machine, run

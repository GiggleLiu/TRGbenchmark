# TRG by julia

This demo requires you having a julia with `LinearAlgebra` and `TensorOperations` pre-installed. 

Also, you can call this demo with parameters, the first parameter will be `T` , the second be `iterations` or `log(lattice size)` and the third be `maximum cut`. e.g

```bash
julia ./trg.jl 1.0 20 20
```
